**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
Ideally, you should provide a reproducible test case.

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.

**Note:** Bug reports should come with a test case or, at least, an analysis.

**Automated tool policy**: If you use an automated tool (e.g., static analysis,
LLM, etc.), you need to demonstrate an understanding of the issue you are raising. Usually, a bug is demonstrated by a test case. Do not copy-paste what a tool is telling you.
